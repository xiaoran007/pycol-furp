Abalone data set

1: Description.

Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements. The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone and counting the number of rings through a microscope. Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age. Further information, such as weather patterns and location (hence food availability) may be required to solve the problem.
